// The cardSwiped functions were moved into CardsCtrl and the resulting
// changes throughout the code (app.js, index.js, and CardsCtrl) were
// updated accordingly. In testing, the cards would not longer be destroyed
// when dragged off screen, so the decision was made to keep this controller
// on its own until the bug could be address.

// Don't fix what ain't broke.
